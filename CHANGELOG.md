  - Automatic loading of profiles from `~/.aws/config` without validation delays
  - Smart bucket loading for selected AWS profiles with comprehensive error handling
  - Support for mixed credential types (manual keys vs. AWS profiles) in the same application

  - Automatic form state management based on error conditions
  - Graceful handling of expired credentials, network issues, and permission errors

### Changed
- **Frontend Architecture Refactor**: Complete modular component reorganization
  - Split large components (AppContent, ObjectsTable, Header) into smaller, focused components
  - Organized components by functionality (layout/, navigation/, object/, ui/, modals/)
  - Created reusable UI component system (Button, Modal, Input, LoadingSpinner, EmptyState)
  - Refactored useS3Operations hook into specialized hooks (useBuckets, useObjects, useS3Delete, etc.)
  - Improved code maintainability and development experience
  - Better performance through smaller, optimized components
  - Enhanced testing capabilities with modular architecture
- **AWS Profile Workflow**: Streamlined profile-based bucket configuration
  - Removed automatic profile validation to eliminate loading delays
  - Lazy validation approach: credentials are checked only when needed
  - Improved form validation logic that adapts to configuration mode (manual vs. profile)
  - Enhanced profile selection UI without status indicators for cleaner experience

### Fixed
- **Dropdown Modal Clipping**: Resolved issues with dropdown menus being cut off by modal boundaries
  - Implemented React portals for dropdown rendering outside modal containers
  - Eliminated need for scrolling within modals to see dropdown options
  - Proper z-index hierarchy: modals (50) < dropdowns (60) < notifications (70)
- **AWS Profile Error Handling**: Comprehensive improvement of error communication
  - Replaced generic "service error" messages with specific, actionable error descriptions
  - Added automatic bucket selection disabling when profile credentials are invalid
  - Clear visual indication when AWS operations fail with recovery suggestions
- **Form State Management**: Intelligent form behavior based on AWS operations
  - Automatic clearing of selected buckets when profile errors occur
  - Prevention of invalid form submissions in AWS Profile mode
  - Proper credential field handling for different configuration modes

### Performance
- **Faster AWS Profile Loading**: Eliminated blocking validation calls during profile enumeration
  - Instant profile loading from local AWS configuration files
  - Deferred validation until actual S3 operations are needed
  - Reduced modal opening time for AWS Profile configuration mode
- **Optimized Dropdown Rendering**: Portal-based dropdowns prevent modal layout recalculation
  - Improved scrolling performance in modals with long dropdown lists
  - Reduced memory usage during dropdown interactions

### Security
- **Enhanced AWS Credential Handling**: Improved security for profile-based configurations
  - Backend automatically selects appropriate credential provider (direct keys vs. AWS profiles)
  - Support for AWS credential provider chain including SSO, instance profiles, and environment variables
  - Reduced credential exposure by supporting profile-only configurations

### Documentation
- **Component Documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md with new AWS Profile integration architecture
- **Specialized Hooks**: Documented focused S3 operation hooks for better code organization
- **AWS Profile System**: Comprehensive documentation of profile-based configuration workflow
- **Dropdown Components**: Technical documentation for portal-based dropdown implementation

## [0.2.2] - 2025-01-01

### Added
- **Show Folder Modified Dates Setting**: New toggle in Configuration to control folder modification date display (default: disabled for better performance)
- Demo GIF in README with dedicated Preview section for better project showcase

### Fixed
- **Critical Drag & Drop Bug**: Fixed issue where dragging a folder would upload the entire parent directory instead of just the selected folder
- **Universal Drag & Drop Logic**: Implemented proper common parent path detection that works for folders at any depth
- **S3 Key Building**: Corrected backend logic to properly handle dragged items regardless of their filesystem location

### Changed
- **Consistent Text Colors**: Unified all text colors in Configuration view to use consistent gray-800/gray-300 pattern for better readability
